# Pladifes Physical Risk Module
## Future economic damages estimations tied to physical disasters based on sectoral wealth densities

In this project we compute sectorial wealth distributions for the Steel, Cement and Electricity Generation Sectors using a non-parametric kernel method. (for the moment only Steel has been done)

This densities will be used to estimate hurricane damages.
Once the damages computed, we'll analyse how they propagate in the economy, from one sector to another using the ARIO model and BoArio python package.
